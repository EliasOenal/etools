 *

 * for high performance and lock-free communication between different threads. This even
 * allows to pass data from and to interrupts. There is only a minor limitation to it:
 * There can only ever be one read- and one write-thread per ecbuff instance. Thus for

/* ECB_THREAD_VOLATILE ***WARNING: USE WITH CARE***
 *
 * Enabling ECB_THREAD_VOLATILE causes ecbuff to rely on the instruction re-ordering
 * restrictions imposed by the volatile keyword. This only affects the compiler's
 * instruction ordering and can't suppress out of order execution.
 * If available ECB_THREAD_BARRIER should be preferred.
 *
 * You should NOT enable this if:
 * 1. Your application communicates between different CPU cores with separate caches.
 * 2. Your architecture reorders stores and/or loads (out of order execution)
 *
 * This option should work on most single core micro-controllers
 * without out of order execution. e.g.:
 * ARM Cortex M (Tested)
 * AVR, PIC, 8051 (Untested)

/* ECB_EXTRA_CHECKS
 *
 * Defining ECB_EXTRA_CHECKS changes the declaration of the read and write api
 * to include a return value. Reading an empty buffer and writing an already
 * full buffer is no longer undefined behaviour. Reading an empty buffer will
 * now return false and prevent buffer corruption. The same is true for writing
 * a full buffer, though the exact behaviour has to be defined with
 * ECB_WRITE_OVERWRITE or ECB_WRITE_DROP.

 *
 * If the buffer is full new data will silently overwrite the oldest element.

/* ECB_DIRECT_ACCESS
 *
 * Enables advanced two staged read/write API.
 *
 * Writing:
 * ecbuff_write_alloc() returns a pointer to the next element which can be written to.
 * ecbuff_write_enqueue() queues the element to be read.
 * Reading:
 * ecbuff_read_dequeue() returns a pointer to the next elememt ready to be read.
 * ecbuff_read_free() frees the memory allocated by the element
 *
 * This exposes the element's memory for direct access by peripherals or DMA,
 * enabling true zero-copy operation.
